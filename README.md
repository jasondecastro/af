# ABP Script

This is a script written for the ABP Course at Flatiron School. The purpose of this script is to generate a CSV with data relating to the student's progress throughout the course. Things like total amount of repositories, commits, lines of code, passed tests, and more.

## Getting Started

cd af
gem install octokit
ruby main.rb
```
